# Plan 1: End-to-End AI Voice Agent Framework with Chatterbox TTS

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to build, document, and deploy a modular AI voice agent framework using Chatterbox TTS. The framework will be designed for extensibility, API integration, and potential deployment as an MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) server.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- Initialize Python project structure
- Set up virtual environment and dependencies (Chatterbox, FastAPI, etc.)
- Configure version control and .gitignore

## 2. Core Framework Design

- Define base interfaces for agents, TTS, and input/output modules
- Implement modular architecture for easy extension and swapping of components
- Add clear documentation and usage examples for each module

## 3. Chatterbox TTS Integration

- Integrate Chatterbox TTS as the default text-to-speech engine
- Provide configuration options for TTS parameters (exaggeration, cfg_weight, etc.)
- Add support for custom voice prompts

## 4. Agent Logic

- Implement a simple agent that takes text input and produces speech output
- Design agent to allow for future NLP/NLU integration
- Add hooks for pre/post-processing of text

## 5. API Layer

- Build a REST API using FastAPI to expose agent functionality
- Endpoints:
  - `/speak` (POST): Accepts text and returns audio
  - `/voices` (GET): Lists available voices/prompts
  - `/config` (GET/POST): Get/set TTS configuration
- Add OpenAPI documentation

## 6. MCP Server Considerations

- Design for multi-channel input/output (e.g., web, phone, chat)
- Implement channel abstraction layer
- Add support for asynchronous processing and scaling
- Plan for authentication and rate limiting

## 7. Testing & Validation

- Write unit and integration tests for all modules
- Add example scripts and API usage demos
- Validate TTS output quality and API performance

## 8. Deployment

- Containerize the application with Docker
- Provide deployment scripts for local, cloud, and MCP environments
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## 9. Monitoring & Maintenance

- Add logging and error handling throughout the stack
- Integrate basic monitoring (health checks, metrics)
- Document maintenance and update procedures

---

## Deliverables

- Modular Python codebase with clear documentation
- REST API for agent interaction
- Dockerfile and deployment scripts
- Example usage and test cases
- Project rules and best practices in .cursor/rules

## Next Steps

1. Confirm and refine this plan as needed
2. Begin with project setup and dependency installation
3. Proceed step-by-step, documenting and testing as we go
