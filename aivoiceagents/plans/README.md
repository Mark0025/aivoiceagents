# Plans Directory

This directory contains versioned project plans and documentation for the AI Voice Agent project.

## How to Use

- Each plan file (e.g., plan0.0.3.md, plan0.0.4.md, plan0.0.5.md) documents the state, goals, and next steps for a specific version or milestone.
- Plans are incremented as the project evolves, with each new version reflecting new features, fixes, or architectural changes.
- Use these plans to track progress, document decisions, and guide development.

## Versioning

- Plans are versioned sequentially (e.g., 0.0.3, 0.0.4, 0.0.5).
- When a major change or milestone is reached, create a new plan file summarizing the new state and next steps.

## Related Files

- See CLI.md and cli_commands.json in the shell_history directory for CLI documentation.
