# Cursor Rule Structure Reference

Each rule file is written in MDC (.mdc), a lightweight format that supports metadata and content in a single file. Rules support the following types:

| Rule Type       | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always          | Always included in the model context                                                         |
| Auto Attached   | Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced                                   |
| Agent Requested | Rule is available to the AI, which decides whether to include it. Must provide a description |
| Manual          | Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName                                      |

# Plans Learning, Testing, and Versioning Rule

- Every plan must have a clear title and version (e.g., `plan2v0.01.md`).
- Break down work into small, logical, and testable steps.
- For each step, explain the concept, write the code, and describe how it was tested.
- Only commit code when it is working and has been verified.
- Document test results and verification for each step.
- Push plans and code to GitHub only after successful testing.
- Never overwrite previous plan versions; always append new ones.
