# Cursor Rule Structure Reference

Each rule file is written in MDC (.mdc), a lightweight format that supports metadata and content in a single file. Rules support the following types:

| Rule Type       | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always          | Always included in the model context                                                         |
| Auto Attached   | Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced                                   |
| Agent Requested | Rule is available to the AI, which decides whether to include it. Must provide a description |
| Manual          | Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName                                      |

Shell commands should be versioned, tested, and iterated for accuracy. Documentation and diagrams should also be generated via shell where possible.

# Shell-Driven Development Rule

- All major code generation, file creation, and modifications must be performed via shell commands or scripts (e.g., bash, zsh), not by directly editing source code.
- Shell commands/scripts should be versioned and documented (e.g., in a `shell_history/` or `scripts/` directory).
- Test the result of each shell command and iterate on the shell command itself for improvements, not by manually editing the generated code.
- Use shell to automate documentation and diagram generation (e.g., with Mermaid CLI, markdown tools).
- This approach ensures reproducibility, accuracy, and leverages the shell as the orchestrator of the development process.
- Only commit generated code after verifying it works as intended.
