# Cursor Rule Structure Reference

Each rule file is written in MDC (.mdc), a lightweight format that supports metadata and content in a single file. Rules support the following types:

| Rule Type       | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always          | Always included in the model context                                                         |
| Auto Attached   | Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced                                   |
| Agent Requested | Rule is available to the AI, which decides whether to include it. Must provide a description |
| Manual          | Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName                                      |

# Plans Versioning and Length Rule

- Every time a new plan is created or updated in the `plans/` directory, save it as a new versioned file (e.g., `plan1v0.01.md`, `plan2v0.02.md`).
- Never overwrite or delete previous versions of plan files; always append new versions.
- Each plan file should be kept within a length that a language model can ingest in one go (recommended: under 200-300 lines of code/content).
- If a plan grows too long, split it into logical parts and version each part separately.
- Document the version and date at the top of each plan file.
- Reference previous versions as needed for traceability.
