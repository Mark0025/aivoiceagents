# Cursor Rule Structure Reference

Each rule file is written in MDC (.mdc), a lightweight format that supports metadata and content in a single file. Rules support the following types:

| Rule Type       | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always          | Always included in the model context                                                         |
| Auto Attached   | Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced                                   |
| Agent Requested | Rule is available to the AI, which decides whether to include it. Must provide a description |
| Manual          | Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName                                      |

# Git Best Practices Rule

- Commit early and often to capture incremental progress.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" as well as the "what".
- Always ensure code is working and tests pass before committing.
- Use branches for new features or experiments; merge only when stable.
- Review diffs before committing to avoid accidental changes.
- Push changes regularly to keep remote in sync and avoid conflicts.
- Never commit sensitive information (e.g., secrets, passwords).
