# Cursor Rule Structure Reference

Each rule file is written in MDC (.mdc), a lightweight format that supports metadata and content in a single file. Rules support the following types:

| Rule Type       | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always          | Always included in the model context                                                         |
| Auto Attached   | Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced                                   |
| Agent Requested | Rule is available to the AI, which decides whether to include it. Must provide a description |
| Manual          | Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName                                      |

# AI Voice Agent Framework Rule

- Use modular, extensible Python code for all agent and TTS components.
- Integrate Chatterbox TTS for all text-to-speech functionality.
- Document all public classes and functions with clear docstrings.
- Write simple usage examples for each module.
- Design agent interfaces to allow easy swapping of TTS, input, and output modules.
- Prefer dependency injection for agent components.
- Include basic tests for each new feature or module.
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous.
- Follow best practices for Python project structure and code style (PEP8).
